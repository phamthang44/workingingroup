          <div class="content">
            <p class="desc lv1">
              Our journey begin at the moment that we arrived at the information
              technology department for the very first time, we immediately
              gathered together and formed a collaborative group. To begin, our
              first purpose was to complete the POSE assignment, which stands
              for Principles of Software Engineering. This was our initial
              objective. In addition, it was the very first time that we had
              ever before had challenges associated with passing the subject
              matter that was being considered. Due to a lack of talent, we have
              been presented with a myriad of problems, particularly in the
              fields of team working, knowledge, labour, and leisure. These
              problems have arisen as a direct consequence of the deficit of
              talent. We did not pay any attention to the lecture, and we did
              not begin working on the assignment until it was very near to the
              time that it was due. In addition, we did not pay any attention
              even to the lecture. The conclusion that we reached was that we
              had made a mistake. Due to the fact that the results of the exam
              left us feeling so disheartened, we made the decision to pursue
              additional schooling after we had finished the test.
            </p>
            <p class="desc lv1">
              Since we hadn’t known how to work as a group, so we didn’t even
              give our group a name. The time come when we attent to “Working in
              group” lectures, at the first thing ever the teacher told us to do
              is making a team. We easily gatther around and again, froming a
              team. The interesting part is when the teacher told us introduce
              ourself to the class, which included our name, sologan. You might
              guess it, we struggled to choose and pick up a name for our group
              too. Thành, a member of our group have one-sided pick “Sciocoo” as
              our group’s team. We believed he was making fun of us until he
              explained why he felt "Sciocoo" was the best name for us; until
              then, we didn't understand what he meant when he stated it meant
              dumb in Italy.
            </p>
            <h2 class="heading lv1">Why we choose this name "Scicco" ?</h2>
            <p class="desc lv1">
              "Stupid" is something that the term itself means. The reason why
              he chose this name, on the other hand, seemed to us as being quite
              plausible. In the beginning, the reason why our group was given
              this name was because the more you studied, the more you immersed
              yourself in the ocean of knowledge, the more you felt like you
              were drowning. However, despite the fact that you are acquiring an
              ever-increasing amount of knowledge and improving your skills, you
              will have the impression that you were previously ignorant and
              that your current level of knowledge is only a drop of water in
              comparison to the vast amount of information that you are capable
              of acquiring eventually. Moreover, he even show us the
              “Dunning–Kruger effect” and states that it’s the best to see
              yourself as a fools, a dummy in order to achieve more and more
              knowledge. In point of fact, the reason why we decided to go with
              his suggestion is that, as we said before, we did not truly commit
              much effort to studying over the previous terms. The processes
              that we have engaged in throughout the class include engaging with
              pursuits such as "mở server đi ông," playing games, and sleeping.
              Following the receipt of the outcome as a consequence of that, we
              come to the realisation that we were really dumb. How did we
              squander all of our time and knowledge and end up with a
              regrettable situation?
            </p>
            <p class="desc lv1">
              Our only subsequent action was to decide to take ourselves
              seriously and begin studying in the right way, which is something
              we should have been doing for months. We must make an even greater
              commitment to research and analysis in order to comprehend how we
              compare to other people if we are to recover from that setback. In
              the time after, Thành re-believed that we are the fool ones who
              have an attraction to knowledge or can be called thirsty for
              knowledge and always want to do more and more assignments so that
              "the fool" might reach their prior level of superiority. Thành has
              had this belief towards us.
